<h2> Hey Hey. </h2>
After a few cups of coffee this morning - I am finally happy to have this blog up and running - it's currently at V.0.3 in my opinion. I will be updating the styling and such later this week.

Allow me to introduce myself while still on this caffeine buzz - gotta love *Sister's Coffee* [local Portland coffee hole]. My name is Edward Duro - I am a 24 year old Front End Developer - or so I like to consider myself a Front End developer. Languages I am pretty efficient with; HTML, CSS, jQuery - catching the grips of Vanilla JavaScript, Meteor JS, NodeJS. The more you know the better off you are! I am self-taught like most people I have met in the industry. I have a passion for Coffee (*warning* lots of coffee references ahead - prepare yourselves) and Developing/Desiging Web Applications.

Portland is an **amazing** place for me at this point in my life, because the weather permits to stay inside like a hermit and just work on developing all day. Regardless of what any Oregonian will tell you it does rain here for about 7-8 months out of the year; it is gloomy; it does flood. Trust me, I am a California Native - **ugh** I *cringe* everytime I have to say that. 

This blog will work as a portfolio and place I can write about my experiences/ things I learn. It will also act as sort of a **fire** behind my a** to keep me moving forward with my programming. Hopefully this will help not only myself out but also help the community out as well!
