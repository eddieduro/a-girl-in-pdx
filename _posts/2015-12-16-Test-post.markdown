Cocktails anyone? It isn't holiday party without the cider, eggnog, and the festive punch bowl. Today I realized the best holiday cocktail is the kind the jingles.

After spending most of my Friday in party planner mode running all over preparing my building for our annual holiday soir&eacute;e I spent some time prepping the best beverage that I have ever tasted. Not to mention, did I say I made it myself?

> Ingredients:
>
> Cherry absolute vodka
>
> Original absolute vodka
>
> Club Soda - I used 7 2 liters (But this also depends on how many people are jingling all the way to your party)

> 2 lbs of freshly juiced ginger (I juiced myself)

> 25 juiced limes

> 4 bunches of fresh mint (juiced with limes)

> Ginger syrup
>
> Cherry juice
>
> ICE...LOTS OF ICE

I had no idea of was such a mixologist. I am a pintrest queen and I have been spending my evenings before bed pinning my favorite beverages in hopes to take a little bit from each to create a great drink from the thing I really love!

If you go don't like ginger? You have no soul and you can't be my friend. This drink is for ginger lovers only, because the ginger taste is amazing and not to overwhelming.
